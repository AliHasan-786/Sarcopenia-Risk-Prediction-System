# Sarcopenia Risk Prediction System

This project uses machine learning pipelines to predict the likelihood of sarcopenia based on medical survey data. It compares three models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost — and visualizes their performance using Tableau.

## 📊 Objective
To identify the most effective predictive model for sarcopenia diagnosis using common classification metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

## 🧠 Models Compared
- **Logistic Regression** (baseline)
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

## 📈 Dashboard
Model performance was visualized in **Tableau** for business-friendly interpretability and comparison:

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Python (scikit-learn, xgboost, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pipeline architecture with `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`
- Data preprocessing: imputation, scaling, encoding
